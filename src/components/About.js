          South Africa . From traveling the world as a cruise ship spa therapist
          ⛴, to finding my passion in writing self-taught lines of code 👩🏾‍💻.{" "}

        <p>
          I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the React framework, still learning others as well. I have
